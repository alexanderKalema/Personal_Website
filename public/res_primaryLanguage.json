Each user has their own differing view of the system and sets of access privileges, enabling them to manage various activities such as payment transactions (deposit, withdrawal, refund), generate detailed reports and statistics on the dashboard, oversee inventory and order management, and handle employee management, among other functionalities. The functionality of this system is quite vast, I recommend checking the user manuals in the drive link above for getting an understanding of the extensive functionalities offered by the system.",
          "As a non-functional requirement, the primary language used in the system is Amharic. This decision was made based on the fact that the admin, cafe committee, cafe manager, and storekeeper, who form a smaller user group, are most (only) comfortable with Amharic. Therefore, their version of the system is exclusively in Amharic. However, considering the larger number of employees with diverse language preferences, the employee version of the system is designed to accommodate five different languages, ensuring inclusivity and ease of use.",
